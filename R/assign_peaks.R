#' Assign peak midpoints to defined gene loci.
#'
#' Determine the midpoints of a set of input regions \code{peaks} and the overlap of the midpoints with a given locus definition \code{locusdef}. Also report the TSS that is nearest each region (peak) overlapping a defined locus and its distance.

#' Typically, this function will not be used alone, but inside \code{chipenrich()}.
#'
#' @param peaks A \code{GRanges} object representing regions to be used for enrichment.
#' @param locusdef A locus definition object from \code{chipenrich.data}.
