#' Run Proximity Regulation test on a set of narrow genomic regions
#' 
#' This method is designed for a set of narrow genomic regions (e.g. TF peaks) and is used to test
#' whether the genomic regions assigned to genes in a gene set are closer to 
#' regulatory locations (i.e. promoters or enhancers) than by chance.
#' 
#' @section Regulatory locations:
#' Current supported regulatory locations are gene transcription
#' start sites (tss) or enhancer locations (hg19 only)
#' 
#' @section Method:
#' ProxReg first calculates the distance between each peak midpoint and 
#' regulatory location in base pairs. For gene transcription start sites, 
#' since parts of the chromosome are more sparse than others, there is an
#' association with gene locus length that needs to be adjusted for.
#' When using tss as the regulatory location, the peak distances are 
#' adjusted for this confounding variable based on an average of 90 ENCODE
#' ChIP-seq experiments (details in citation pending). Similarly, for enhancers, 
#' distances depend on the density of enhancers within a gene locus, so distance
#' to enhancer is adjusted using an empirical average of 90 ChIP-seq ENCODE
#' experiments.
#' 
#' For each gene set of interest, the genomic regions are divided into two groups indicating
#' the gene with the nearest tss is in the gene set or not. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test is 
#' then done to test for a difference in the adjusted distances (either to tss or enhancer).
#' 
#' @param peaks Either a file path or a \code{data.frame} of peaks in BED-like
#' format. If a file path, the following formats are fully supported via their
#' file extensions: .bed, .broadPeak, .narrowPeak, .gff3, .gff2, .gff, and .bedGraph
#' or .bdg. BED3 through BED6 files are supported under the .bed extension. Files
#' without these extensions are supported under the conditions that the first 3
#' columns correspond to 'chr', 'start', and 'end' and that there is either no
#' header column, or it is commented out. If a \code{data.frame} A BEDX+Y style
#' \code{data.frame}. See \code{GenomicRanges::makeGRangesFromDataFrame} for
#' acceptable column names.
#' @param out_name Prefix string to use for naming output files. This should not
#' contain any characters that would be illegal for the system being used (Unix,
#' Windows, etc.) The default value is "proxReg", and a file "proxReg_results.tab"
#' is produced. If \code{qc_plots} is set, then a file "proxReg_qcplots.pdf"
#' is produced containing a number of quality control plots. If \code{out_name}
#' is set to NULL, no files are written, and results then must be retrieved from
#' the list returned by \code{proxReg}.
#' @param out_path Directory to which results files will be written out. Defaults
#' to the current working directory as returned by \code{\link{getwd}}.
#' @param genome One of the \code{supported_genomes()}. If reglocation = enhancer,
#' genome MUST be 'hg19'.
#' @param genesets A character vector of geneset databases to be tested for
#' enrichment. See \code{supported_genesets()}. Alternately, a file path to
#' a tab-delimited text file with header and first column being the geneset ID
#' or name, and the second column being Entrez Gene IDs. For an example custom
#' gene set file, see the vignette.
#' @param randomization One of: 'shuffle', 'unif', 'bylength', 'byenh'. These were used to
#' test for Type I error under the null hypothesis. A general user will never have to
#' use these.
#' @param reglocation One of: 'tss', 'enhancer'. Details in the "Regulatory locations" section
#' @param qc_plots A logical variable that enables the automatic generation of
#' plots for quality control.
#' @param min_geneset_size Sets the minimum number of genes a gene set may have
#' to be considered for testing.
#' @param max_geneset_size Sets the maximum number of genes a gene set may have
#' to be considered for testing.
#' @param n_cores The number of cores to use for testing. We recommend
#' using only up to the maximum number of \emph{physical} cores present, as
#' virtual cores do not significantly decrease runtime. Default number of cores
#' is set to 1. NOTE: Windows does not support multicore testing.
#' 
#' @return A list, containing the following items:
#'
#' \item{opts }{A data frame containing the arguments/values passed to \code{polyenrich}.}
#'
#' \item{peaks }{
#' A data frame containing peak assignments to genes. Peaks which do not overlap
#' a gene locus are not included. Each peak that was assigned to a gene is listed,
#' along with the peak midpoint or peak interval coordinates (depending on which
#' was used), the gene to which the peak was assigned, the locus start and end
#' position of the gene, and the distance from the peak to the TSS.

#'   \item{dist_to_tss}{the distance in bp to the closest TSS to this peak. }
#'   \item{nearest_tss_gene}{the gene having the closest TSS to the peak (should be the same as gene_id when using the nearest TSS locus definition.) }
#'   \item{nearest_tss_gene_strand}{the strand of the gene with the closest TSS. }
#'   \item{log_dtss}{ log of dist_to_tss}
#'   \item{log_gene_ll}{the log of length of the gene locus in bp }
#'   \item{scaled_dtss}{the adjusted distance to TSS, used in the calculations. Shown if reglocation = "tss" }
#'   \item{dist_to_enh}{the distance to the nearest enhancer. Shown if reglocation = "enhancer" }

#' A data frame of the results from performing the proxReg test on

#'   \item{Description}{ gives a definition of the geneset. For example, "reproduction."}
#'   \item{P.Value}{the probability of observing the proxmity of genomic regions in the gene set given the null hypothesis that peaks are not closer or farther in the gene set.}
#'   \item{FDR}{the false discovery rate proposed by Bejamini \& Hochberg for adjusting the p-value to control for family-wise error rate.}
#'   \item{Effect}{the signed Wilcoxon statistic, with positive values meaning the gene set has closer genomic regions than expected by chance.}
#'   \item{Status}{specifies if the peaks in the gene set tend to be closer or farther than those not in the gene set.}
#'   \item{Odds.Ratio}{the estimated odds that peaks are associated with a given gene set compared to the odds that peaks are associated with other gene sets, after controlling for locus length and/or mappability.  An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates enrichment, and less than 1 indicates depletion.}
#'   \item{N.Geneset.Genes}{the number of genes in the gene set.}
